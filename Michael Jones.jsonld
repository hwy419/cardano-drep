    "objectives": "I am committed to strengthening Cardano's decentralization by advocating for a diverse ecosystem of operators, builders, and participants from all backgrounds. My priorities: (1) Uphold the Constitution as the foundation of all governance decisions; (2) Ensure technical parameters support network security, scalability, and long-term sustainability; (3) Champion policies that empower developers and builders to create world-class tooling and dApps; (4) Promote transparency by publishing my voting rationale for every governance action. I envision Cardano achieving global adoption as critical infrastructure for finance, identity, and beyond—built on a thriving developer community and truly decentralized governance.",
    "motivations": "With over 20 years in technology—spanning enterprise systems architecture, leadership, and blockchain development—I've seen firsthand how centralized systems fail their users. I discovered Cardano over five years ago and was drawn to its research-first methodology and long-term sustainability vision. As a builder in this ecosystem, I've developed dApps, smart contracts, tooling, and infrastructure that serve our community. I believe governance decisions should be made by those who understand both the technical implications and the human impact. I'm not here for short-term gains; my stake is aligned with Cardano's long-term success, and I want to ensure our network thrives for generations.",
    "qualifications": "20+ years of professional technology experience in enterprise systems, technical architecture, and leadership roles. Active Cardano ecosystem builder for 5+ years: developed dApps, smart contracts, developer tooling, and infrastructure. Deep understanding of blockchain technology, consensus mechanisms, and the technical parameters that govern network health. Constitution-first approach to voting decisions, combined with independent technical judgment. Long-term ADA holder with interests directly aligned with network success. Committed to transparency and accessibility—I will publish my voting rationale and remain available to discuss governance with delegators.",
